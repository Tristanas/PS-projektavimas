# General info:
This repository is for Software Systems Design class. 

Labs consist of projects, which require both a design (MagicDraw project) and a compilable project. The main goal is to gain understanding of design patterns, apply them in practice and gain intuition when picking a design pattern.

## First task:

### Requirements:
 - 1 entity (user, product, etc.) that has variable functionality.
 - Use Template Method for one implementation and Strategy pattern for another one.
 - Compare both methods.
 - Console application with at least a few lines of output.
 - Carry out changes:
  - Create a new variation.
  - Change implementation of a certain initial variation.
